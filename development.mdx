<Info>
  Keep your docs and SDK development in the same workspace so you can document flows while you implement them. The commands below assume the repo structure in this starter (`documentation/` for Mintlify, `cradle-client-ts/` for the SDK).
</Info>

## 1. Prep your environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
echo "CRADLE_API_KEY=sk_live_..." >> .env.local
echo "CRADLE_BASE_URL=https://api.cradle.example.com" >> .env.local
```

Load the file in your shell (`source .env.local`) or use a runtime-specific secret manager. Never hardcode API keys inside Markdown examples—pass them as environment variables and interpolate them with placeholders.

## 2. Install dependencies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Docs workspace">

```bash
cd documentation
npm install
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="SDK workspace">

```bash
cd cradle-client-ts
npm install
npm run build
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

When contributing examples back to the docs, import from the published `cradle-api-client` package so code samples match what customers copy.

## 3. Preview and iterate

```bash
cd documentation
mint dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to verify copy, navigation, and components. Pass a different port if you already have a web server running:

```bash
mint dev --port 4000
```

Use `<Snippet />` blocks for reusable code and `<Tabs />` or `<Steps />` to keep walkthroughs scannable.

## 4. Validate links and samples

```bash
mint broken-links
npm run lint:mdx       # optional, add to package.json if needed
```

For SDK samples, run a dry request against the sandbox base URL:

```ts
await cradle.getMarket('sandbox-market-id');
```

Use response fixtures for deterministic docs when calling production-only endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='CLI cannot find "sharp" on macOS'>
    Upgrade to Node 18+, reinstall the Mintlify CLI (`npm remove -g mint && npm i -g mint`), then clear `~/.mintlify`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="401 responses locally">
    Confirm the `Authorization: Bearer` header is being set by the SDK. Missing or staged API keys are the most common cause. Regenerate keys in the dashboard and restart your dev server.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Network timeouts">
    Increase the `timeout` parameter when instantiating `CradleApiClient`, or test against the sandbox URL if the production environment is geographically distant.
