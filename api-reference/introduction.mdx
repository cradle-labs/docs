The `cradle-api-client` package is a typed wrapper around the REST API. Each method maps 1:1 to an endpoint and resolves with an `ApiResponse<T>` envelope so you can treat reads and writes consistently.

## Installation

```bash
npm install cradle-api-client axios
```

```ts
import { CradleApiClient } from 'cradle-api-client';

export const cradle = new CradleApiClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.cradle.example.com',
  apiKey: process.env.CRADLE_API_KEY!,
  timeout: 30_000,
});
```

## Response envelope

```ts
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data: T | null;
  error: string | null;
}
```

- `success` — `true` when the request succeeded.
- `data` — fully typed payload for successful calls, `null` otherwise.
- `error` — server or network error message (localized to English).

## Helper utilities

Mutation endpoints return discriminated unions. Use `MutationResponseHelpers` to narrow them safely:

```ts
if (response.success && response.data) {
  if (MutationResponseHelpers.isCreateAccount(response.data)) {
    const id = response.data.Accounts.CreateAccount;
  }
}
```

Helpers exist for Accounts, Assets, Markets, OrderBook, Time Series, and Lending pool mutations.
