## Why Cradle

Cradle is a programmable finance platform for institutions that need to orchestrate accounts, assets, markets, and credit experiences on Hedera. The TypeScript SDK gives you fully typed access to every REST capability, including read models, liquidity operations, and mutation workflows.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure access">
    Generate an API key in the Cradle Console, store it as an environment variable, and initialize `CradleApiClient`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ship your flow">
    Use the guides under <Link href="/guides/authentication">Build with Cradle</Link> to connect accounts, trade, or manage liquidity.
  </Step>

## SDK at a glance

```ts
import { CradleApiClient } from 'cradle-api-client';

const client = new CradleApiClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.cradle.example.com',
  apiKey: process.env.CRADLE_API_KEY!,
  timeout: 30000,
});

const health = await client.health();
const pools = await client.getLendingPools();
```

<Note>
  All SDK methods resolve to a shared `ApiResponse<T>` envelope. Always check `success`
  before reading `data`, and fall back to `error` for surfaced failure reasons.
